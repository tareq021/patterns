Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects, such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified.

Benefits:
* It describes the coupling between the objects and the observer.
* It provides the support for broadcast-type communication.


Consider two situations for border guards guarding an area.

Situation-1: Enemy plane detected in the sky.

Response: Both ground and Air troops will be notified.


Situation-2: Civilian person detected near the no-civilian zone.

Response: Only ground troops will be notified.

Both of the above situations are ideal candidates for observer pattern example.
